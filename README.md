# Computer Science Website
This is my AP Computer Science Principles portfolio website.
Enjoy!

v1.0 <br/>
This is the first version of my website.
 - Added "Home", "Portfolio", and "About Me" pages
 - Added "style.css" and "script.js" for extra functionality
 - Added "Images" and "Sounds" folders for extra elements
 - Used "style.css" to make the fixed navigation bar and a gradient background
 - Filled the "About Me" page with images and text
 - Added an audio controller that auto-plays music to each page
