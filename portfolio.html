			<p>Our first project, Draw It Yourself, allows the user to choose the shape, color, size, and
			 location of an object in an underwater environment. The program asks the user
			 specific questions, for example "What shape would you like to draw?, and the user
			 answers using a list of given objects. Then, the user also picks a color, size, and
			 location and the program draws it for them. Finally, the program asks the user to if
			 they would like to coninue drawing shapes.</p>

			<p>The second project we created is based off of Hangman. A random word is chosen from a list of
			 words. The user uses the console to try to guess the letters in the word. For each correct letter,
			 a mouse moves closer to a piece of cheese and the correct letter is written in the correct place on
			 the screen. If a guess is incorrect, a point is taken away from the guess counter. Once the mouse
			 gets the cheese or the guess counter hits zero, the game will end.</p>

			<img src="Images/Images/cupgame.PNG" alt="Cup Game" width="1000px">
			<p>This third project is a recreation of the cup game. In the cup game, the cups are shuffled and
			 the user has to follow the cups and pick the one with the ball inside. At the start of the game,
			 the user enters their name, chooses a ball color, and a difficulty to play the game at. When a the
			 the correct cup is chosen, a score counter increases and the user has the option to play again and
			 change the difficulty. If the wrong cup is chosen, the game ends and a leaderboard appears.</p>

			<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/461531517/">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/461531517/</a>
			<p>This project was created using scratch. We created a level by level game where an elf must travel
			 to the North Pole battling enemies to get the gifts from an evil Santa. The game includes movement
			 controls, health counters, sound effects, background and sprite changes, and a lot of code to create
			 each level.</p>
